% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% *** SPECIALIZED LMST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\begin{abstract}
In this letter, a fast frequency estimation approach is proposed using frequency-shift filtering. The original sampled signal is first frequency-shifted by a reference signal. Then a convolution average filter is applied on the shifted signal to eliminate the spectral interference caused by asynchronous sampling. Finally, frequency of power system can be estimated using the phase difference between arbitrary two points of the filtered signal. 
The approach has major advantages of low computational burden, which makes it appropriate for high reporting rate frequency measurement in embedded systems. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

%As a consequence of this, how to achieve the accuracy of frequency measurement has triggered a growing concern from both academics and businessmen.
\IEEEPARstart{F}{requency} is one the most critical parameters to indicate the operation status of  power grid. Therefore, accurate and prompt estimation of frequency is a vital task of wide-area measurement system.

Several digital signal processing  techniques have been proposed so far in the literature to estimate the power grid frequency such as: Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) \cite{7438889} and wavelet transform\cite{7981350}, Prony\cite{8263521}, and  Kalman filter\cite{Bagheri2016}.
Among them, DFT based methods is the most commonly
used techniques in commercial Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and digital relays for frequency estimation due to its advantage of easy hardware implementation and harmonic immunity\cite{7277049,5876287}. To reduce the influence of spectral leakage , Windowed Interpolation DFT (WIDFT) algorithm was used to improve the performance under the conditions of asynchronous sampling \cite{4956674}.
Unfortunately, the WIDFT involve computationally expensive procedures of solving high-order equations.
A Recursive DFT (RDFT) calculation method was developed by A.G. Phadke and J. S. Thorp with significant reduction on computational complexity\cite{5519136}. To achieve the high accuracy under  off-nominal condition, least square estimation and resample calculation is applied on RDFT \cite{chenjian}. This approach has been successfully implemented in  Frequency Disturbance
Recorders (FDRs) of FNET/Grideye with reporting rate 10 Hz, which is used for providing synchronized frequency measurement at worldwide distribution level power grid\cite{7265090}. However, for  applications such as  power system transient process observation, frequency nadir prediction under larger disturbance and instant frequency-based load control, a much higher reporting rate of  measurements, e.g., 120 or 240 Hz, is needed. However, the execution time of RDFT in real hardware implementation,e.g. FDR, can not meet the real-time requirement. Therefore,  the necessity to explore a more efficient frequency estimation approach with   satisfactory performance arises.

 In this paper, a fast frequency estimation approach is proposed for practical application using frequency-shift filtering. 
 The main idea of the this approach is to shift fundamental components to 0 Hz, and then use a Convolution Averaging Filter (CAF) to eliminate spectral interferences and white noise. The extensive computation of least square estimation and resample process in RDFT can be avoided. It has major advantages of high accuracy and low computational complexity.

% SECTION II:
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Proposed  algorithm}
Assuming  actual power grid signal distorted by harmonic is sampled at  an interval $T_s=1/f_s$ in a measurement device,  the sampled discrete-time signal $x(n)$ can be represented by
\begin{equation}
x(n)\equiv x_a(nT_s)=\sum_{h=1}^{H}A_h\cos (h2\pi f_r/f_s+\varphi_h)\label{eqn_3}
\end{equation}
where $f_r$ is the real fundamental frequency and $f_s$ is the sampling rate. $h$ stands for the order of harmonic, $A_h$ and $\varphi_h$ denote the amplitude and phase of  harmonics, respectively.
We assume the sampling frequency $f_s$ is an integral multiple of the nominal frequency $f_\mathrm{nom}$ as $f_s=Mf_\mathrm{nom}$ and define normalized angular frequency as  $\omega_r=2\pi f_r/(Mf_\mathrm{nom})$. 

According to the Euler identity, $x(n)$ can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
x(n)=\sum_{h=1}^{H}\dfrac{A_h}{2}\left(e^{j\left(h\omega_r n+\varphi_h\right)}+e^{-j\left(h\omega_r n+\varphi_h\right)}\right)\label{eqn_4}
\end{equation}
%Hence, the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of $x(n)$ is
%\begin{align}
%X(e^{j\omega})=&\pi A_h\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\bigg[\delta\left(h\omega_r n+\varphi_h+2\pi k\right)\notag\\
%&+\left.\delta\left(h\omega_r n+\varphi_h+2\pi k\right)\right]\label{eqn_5}
%\end{align}



Defining a reference signal to shift original sampled signal, it can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
r(n)=e^{j\omega_\mathrm{nom}n}\label{eqn_yao}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_\mathrm{nom}=2\pi /M$.  
Multiplying both sides of \eqref{eqn_4} by the exponential signal $r(n)$ in time domain, we can get shifted signal

\begin{align}%=&x(n)e^{j\omega_\mathrm{nom}n}\notag\\
x_s(n)=&\sum_{h=1}^{H}\dfrac{A_h}{2}\left(e^{j\left((h\omega_r+\omega_\mathrm{nom})n+\varphi_h\right)}\right.\notag\\
&\left.+e^{-j\left((h\omega_r -\omega_\mathrm{nom})n+\varphi_h\right)}\right)\label{eqn_5}
\end{align}

It can be seen from  \eqref{eqn_5} that the frequency components of $x(n)$ are all shifted  from $h\omega_r$ and $-h\omega_r$ to $h\omega_r+\omega_\mathrm{nom}$ and $-h\omega_r+\omega_\mathrm{nom}$, respectively. Consequently, the spectral line of fundamental components are shifted around 0 Hz in frequency domain since the $f_r$ slight fluctuates around $f_\mathrm{nom}$.

To eliminate the spectral interferences of harmonic, a moving average filter is applied on the shifted signal $x_s(n)$. The  moving average filter of length $M$ can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
h_\mathrm{av}(m)=\begin{cases}
1/M,\qquad &m=0,1,\ldots,M-1\\
0, &\text{otherwise.}\\
\end{cases}\label{eqn_6}
\end{equation}
The frequency response of $h_\mathrm{av}(m)$ is
\begin{equation}
H(e^{j\omega})=\dfrac{1}{M}\sum_{n=0}^{M-1}e^{j\omega n}=\dfrac{\sin(\omega M/2)}{M\sin(\omega/2)}e^{-j\omega (M-1)/2}\label{eqn_7}
\end{equation}
and its magnitude frequency responses is
\begin{equation}
|H(e^{j\omega })|=\left|\dfrac{\sin(\omega M/2)}{M\sin(\omega/2)}\right|\mathrm{.}\label{eqn_8}
\end{equation}
Thus, $|H(e^{j\omega })|$ yields $0$ for the cases $\omega=2\pi k/M,k=0,1,\ldots,M-1$.

Let us divide the normalized angular frequencies into two parts after frequency shifting, that is, the negative angular frequencies $\omega_n(h)=-h\omega_r+\omega_\mathrm{nom}$ and the positive angular frequencies $\omega_p(h)=h\omega_r+\omega_\mathrm{nom}$. Since $\omega_n(1)=\omega_\mathrm{nom}-\omega_r\approx0$ for $h=1$, from \eqref{eqn_8} we have $|H(e^{j\omega_n(1)}|\approx1$. Similarity, it can be obtained that $|H(e^{j\omega_n(h)})|\approx0$ for $h\neq1$ and $|H(e^{j\omega_p(h)})|\approx0$, respectively. As as result, only the frequency component $\omega_\mathrm{nom}-\omega_r$ is reserved and the other frequencies are suppressed after the  filter.

To achieve better suppression effect on the interference, a $p$th order CAF is constructed as

\begin{equation}
h_p(n)=\underbrace{h_{av}(m)*\cdots*h_{av}(m)}_{p}\label{eqn_9}
\end{equation}
where $*$ denotes convolution operation, $p$ represents the number of the CAF, and the length of the $p$th order CAF is $p(M-1)+1$. Since coefficients of CAF are constant, they can be pre-computed to decrease computational burden and only one time convolution calculation between $x_s(n)$ and $h_p(n)$ is needed. 
\begin{figure}[t]

	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{freqresponse2.eps}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{har2.eps}
		
	\caption{Harmonic distortion test result }
	\label{fig_4}									
\end{figure}




The magnitude frequency response of the first order CAF to the fourth order CAF are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig_1}. It can bee observed in Fig.~\ref{fig_1} that the capacity of interference inhibition  of CAF is proportional to the convolution order $p$. Defining the length of truncation window is $L$, the computational complexity of the proposed method is $O(pL)$, where  $O( )$ means time complexity
notation.
The signal after applying frequency shifting and CAF  can be approximated  as
\begin{equation}
x_f(n)=h_p(n)*x_s(n)\approx\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\dfrac{A_h}{2}e^{j\left((\omega_\mathrm{nom}-\omega_r)n+\varphi_1\right)}\label{eqn_10}
\end{equation}
%Fig.~\ref{fig_2} in the next page illustrates the computational procedure of the proposed algorithm.%In order to gain a better understanding of the procedure of our proposed method, we demonstrate the process graphically in

%\begin{figure*}
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=7in]{Fig1.eps}
%	\caption{The computational procedure of frequency estimation with the proposed method.}
%	\label{fig_2}													
%\end{figure*}

Then the frequency deviation can obtained using phase difference of two 
 points in $x_f(n)$ as 

\begin{equation}
\Delta f=\dfrac{(\arg(x_f(n_1))-\arg(x_f(n_2))Mf_\mathrm{nom}}{2\pi(n1-n2)}.\label{eqn_12}
\end{equation}
Consequently, the estimated fundamental frequency is
\begin{equation}
f_\mathrm{est}=f_\mathrm{nom}+\Delta f\label{eqn_13}
\end{equation}

\section{Simulation results and analysis}
Simulations are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed approach. The performance is also compared with FDR algorithm\cite{chenjian,7265090}, which is denoted as RDFT in this section.
The nominal frequency $f_\mathrm{nom}$ is 60 Hz and the sampling rate $f_s$ is 1440 Hz. Note that both algorithms were implemented in a “sliding window” approach, i.e., continuously shifting the estimation window by a single sample, which means that the frequency estimation rate is equal to sampling rate. Since the order $p$ influences of accuracy and computational burden, the proposed approach with $p$ from 1 to 4 are evaluated. For each test scenario, 10000 simulation runs have been performed to evaluate the statistical properties.  

For the frequency range test, the  frequency of  input sinusoidal signal  varies from 59.9 Hz to 60.1 Hz with the step 0.01 Hz. The results is shown in Fig.\ref{fig_2}. It can be seen that accuracy of the proposed method is proportional to the $p$. Moreover, the proposed method with  $p\geq2$ can offer a better accuracy compared to the RDFT.

To evaluate the performance with white noise, Gaussian white noise with zero mean is superposed on the 59.95 Hz test signal. The accuracy is evaluated under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) ranging from
20 to 100 dB at an increment of 10 dB. The Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is also used to provide a quantitative benchmark of
 measurement error as shown in Fig.\ref{fig_3}. In this semilog
plot, it can be seen that the proposed method with larger $p$ is closer
to the CRLB. The results also  demonstrates that the  proposed method with $p\geq2$ has high reliability and accuracy in a noisy signal environment than conventional RDFT.

For harmonic distortion  test, the test
signal consists of a fundamental frequency component and
an odd harmonic component ranging from 3rd order  to 11th order. The magnitude is 0.1 p.u (20 dB with respect to the fundamental 
component), which is the worst condition according to the IEEE  C37.118 standard\cite{c37}. Besides, 80 dB white noise is added, which is  selected based on the study of noise at the distribution level grid in Ref.\cite{7051271}. From Fig.\ref{fig_4}, the error of the proposed method is whtin 0.2 mHz and much less than the 5m Hz requirements for P-class PMU in the C37 standard. We can conclude that the proposed method is immune to the harmonic distortion.

The comparative results of computation time  are listed in Table~\ref{table_1}. The  results confirm the superiority
of the proposed algorithm in lower computational complexity. Taking account all the above results, to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and estimation time,  $p=2$ can be considered as reasonable selection in practical implementation  since keeping increasing $p$ does not improve the performance significantly but introducing much higher computational effort.

\section{Conclusion}
In this letter, a novel  frequency estimation approach combining frequency shifting and convolution average filtering is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed method has merit of low computational complexity, robust performance in the presence of noise, harmonic and off-nominal conditions. There advantages make it appropriate and promising for the real-time application in digital relays and  high reporting rate synchronized measurement devices.
