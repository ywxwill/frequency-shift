  Abstract                 = {The proper operation of single-phase and three-phase grid-connected power converters depends on the synchronization with utility networks. The major challenge of the synchronization is how to quickly and precisely extract the ac signal and fundamental positive sequence in single- and three-phase power systems, respectively. This paper proposes a new detection technique based on a modified Kalman filter and the generalized averaging method. The method has an open-loop structure, and uses the orthogonal signals which are obtained directly from the Kalman filter. The resulted detection system is very simple and robust even in the presence of power quality disturbances, such as voltage imbalance, harmonics, and voltage fluctuations. The proposed technique can detect the fundamental and harmonics frequencies within or less than half a cycle in all situations, such as small and considerable frequency variations. Meanwhile, the method guarantees the zero steady-state error in complicated harmonic scenarios, including all typical single-phase and three-phase harmonics. Various case studies are assessed and the performance of the proposed detection method is verified by experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The spectrum-estimation methods based on the Fourier transform suffer from the major problem of resolution. The methods were developed and are mostly applied for periodic signals under the assumption that only harmonics are present and the periodicity intervals are fixed, while periodicity intervals in the presence of interharmonics are variable and very long. A novel approach to harmonic and interharmonic analysis based on the "subspace" methods is proposed. Min-norm and music harmonic retrieval methods are examples of high-resolution eigenstructure-based methods. Their resolution is theoretically independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The Prony method as applied for parameter estimation of signal components was also tested in the paper. Both the high-resolution methods do not show the disadvantages of the traditional tools and allow exact estimation of the interharmonic frequencies. To investigate the methods, several experiments were carried out using simulated signals, current waveforms at the output of an industrial frequency converter, and current waveforms during out-of-step operation of a synchronous generator. For comparison, similar experiments were repeated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The comparison proved the superiority of the new methods.},

The noneven item interpolation FFT based on the triangular self-convolution window is described. A simple analytical expression for the variance of noise contribution on the frequency estimation is derived, which shows the variances of frequency estimation are proportional to the energy of the adopted window. Based on the proposed method, the noise level of the measurement channel can be estimated, and optimal parameters (e.g., sampling frequency and window length) of the interpolation FFT algorithm that minimize the variances of frequency estimation can thus be determined. The application in a power quality analyzer verified the usefulness of the proposed method.},

This paper presents a new harmonic analysis algorithm, which successfully adjusts an actual sampling sequence to an ideal sampling sequence synchronized with the original signal. First, a fundamental period is evaluated by a zero-crossing technique, and then, according to this fundamental period, the sampling sequence is reconstructed by the time-domain Newton's interpolation polynomial. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy in measuring distorted and noisy signals by reducing spectral leakage effectively in the framework of the International Electrotechnical Commission standards. Moreover, the proposed method maintains high measurement accuracy for nonstationary and slow-changing signals even at low-frequency resolution. The results of the field experiment confirm the effectiveness of this algorithm under practical considerations.},

The modification constitutes in a specific selection of a constant frequency vector in a Fourier-like manner leading to a remarkable reduction of the computational burden and enabling online real-time computations.
